libjson-perl (2.50-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The upstream JSON package formerly consisted of the main module,
  JSON, which was an interface that selected the best available
  module (in order):

   * JSON::XS (available as libjson-xs-perl)
   * JSON::PP (formerly included in the JSON package, now available
     separately as libjson-pp-perl)

  The JSON::PP module is now available in a separate distribution
  and corresponding Debian package, and the JSON::PP module formerly
  included with this package has been renamed to JSON::backportPP.

  As the JSON::backportPP module may be removed in a future release,
  it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that users install BOTH: libjson-pp-perl
  and libjson-xs-perl.
